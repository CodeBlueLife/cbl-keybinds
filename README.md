# cbl-keybinds

This resource provides a flexible keybinding system built on FiveM’s native key mapping API.
It supports global and per-resource binds, keydown and keyup callbacks, runtime registration, and automatic loading on resource start.

Keys can be temporarily disabled individually or entirely (useful for UI focus, menus, and cutscenes), while still allowing clean re-enable logic.
The system also includes human-readable key label resolution for UI prompts, handling keyboard and mouse inputs.

Default global action binds are configurable, and simple exports are provided for adding binds, toggling input state, and retrieving current key labels.
